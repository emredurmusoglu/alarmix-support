      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how AlarMix (“the App”) handles information. AlarMix is designed to work without requiring
        personal details such as your name, email address, or account information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      AlarMix does not request personal information such as name, email address, or account details. However, some anonymous
      information may be collected automatically through advertising services. This may include device type, operating system,
      in-app ad interactions, and approximate location at the country or region level.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      AlarMix uses banner ads and rewarded ads. Ads may be provided by third-party advertising services. These providers may
      collect anonymous data to display ads and measure advertising performance. AlarMix does not share personally identifiable
      information with advertising providers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      AlarMix does not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies. We do not use collected data for tracking
      or profiling purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      Collected anonymous data is used only to display ads, enable rewarded ad functionality, improve app performance, and perform
      statistical analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      User data is not sold or rented. Data may be shared only with advertising service providers as required for the operation of
      the app (for example, to display ads and measure ad performance).
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      AlarMix does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. Parents or legal guardians are responsible
      for supervising their children’s use of the app.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      AlarMix takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect user privacy. However, no method of data transmission
      over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will become effective once published within the app or on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>

      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at
